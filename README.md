AIML_Tourism Experience Analytics
Problem Statement:
Tourism agencies and travel platforms aim to enhance user experiences by leveraging data to provide personalized recommendations, predict user satisfaction, and classify potential user behavior. This project involves analyzing user preferences, travel patterns, and attraction features to achieve three primary objectives: regression, classification, and recommendation.
Business Use Cases:
Personalized Recommendations: Suggest attractions based on users' past visits, preferences, and demographic data, improving user experience.
Tourism Analytics: Provide insights into popular attractions and regions, enabling tourism businesses to adjust their offerings accordingly.
Customer Segmentation: Classify users into segments based on their travel behavior, allowing for targeted promotions.
Increasing Customer Retention: By offering personalized recommendations, businesses can boost customer loyalty and retention.

Objective:
1. Regression: Predicting Attraction Ratings
Aim:
Develop a regression model to predict the rating a user might give to a tourist attraction based on historical data, user demographics, and attraction features.
Use Case:
Travel platforms can use this model to estimate the satisfaction level of users visiting specific attractions. By identifying attractions likely to receive lower ratings, agencies can take corrective actions, such as improving services or better setting user expectations.
Personal travel guides can provide users with attractions most aligned with their preferences to enhance overall satisfaction.
Possible Inputs (Features):
User demographics: Continent, region, country, city.
Visit details: Year, month, mode of visit (e.g., business, family, friends).
Attraction attributes: Type (e.g., beaches, ruins), location, and previous average ratings.
Target:
Predicted rating (on a scale, e.g., 1-5).
2. Classification: User Visit Mode Prediction
Aim:
Create a classification model to predict the mode of visit (e.g., business, family, couples, friends) based on user and attraction data.
Use Case:
Travel platforms can use this model to tailor marketing campaigns. For instance, if a user is predicted to travel with family, family-friendly packages can be promoted.
Hotels and attraction organizers can plan resources (e.g., amenities) better based on predicted visitor types.
Inputs (Features):
User demographics: Continent, region, country, city.
Attraction characteristics: Type, popularity, previous visitor demographics.
Historical visit data: Month, year, previous visit modes.
Target:
Visit mode (categories: Business, Family, Couples, Friends, etc.).
3. Recommendations: Personalized Attraction Suggestions
Objective:
Develop a recommendation system to suggest tourist attractions based on a user's historical preferences and similar users’ preferences.
Use Case:
Travel platforms can implement this system to guide users toward attractions they are most likely to enjoy, increasing user engagement and satisfaction.
Destination management organizations can identify emerging trends and promote attractions that align with user preferences.
Types of Recommendation Approaches:
Collaborative Filtering:
Recommend attractions based on similar users’ ratings and preferences.
Content-Based Filtering:
Suggest attractions similar to those already visited by the user based on features like attraction type, location, and amenities.
Hybrid Systems:
Combine collaborative and content-based methods for enhanced accuracy.
Inputs (Features):
User visit history: Attractions visited, ratings given.
Attraction features: Type, location, popularity.
Similar user data: Travel patterns and preferences.
Output:
Ranked list of recommended attractions.
